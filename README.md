# opening_hours bot

This repository keeps track of scripts I use to speed up the Quality Assurance process of [opening\_hours][key:opening\_hours] values. Although the repository has the word 'bot' in it, the scripts do not yet (if ever) run as bot. I do review every change which are made by these scripts. Additionally all changes are automatically checked using the [pyopening\_hours][] library (old value must be an error and the new one must be ok without any warnings).

[pyopening\_hours]: https://github.com/ypid/pyopening_hours

[key:opening\_hours]: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours
[oh-lib]: https://github.com/ypid/opening_hours.js

## Install

Just clone the repository with

```Shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ypid/opening_hours_bot.git
```

and install itâ€™s dependencies (execute inside the repository):
```Shell
cd pyopening_hours/ && npm install
```

## Usage
The script `OpeningHoursBot.py` can be called with an [.osm (from JOSM)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM_file_format) file as parameter and will write a corrected `$basename-fixed.osm` file.
